/**
 * Single source of truth for order/shipment status TEXT.
 *
 * Every stage an order can be in — from the moment it's placed to the
 * moment it's delivered (or cancelled/delayed along the way) — lives
 * in one place. dashboard.blade.php, order.blade.php and
 * shipping.blade.php all call OrderStatus::label() instead of keeping
 * their own copy of the wording, so the three tabs can never drift
 * out of sync with each other again (e.g. "READY_TO_SHIP" showing as
 * raw DB text on one page and "READY FOR DELIVERY" on another).
 *
 * Colors are intentionally handled separately, per page, because each
 * blade already has its own badge markup (.tag-*, .status-*,
 * .status-tag.tag-*, .status-pill.tag-*). What matters is that the
 * *tier* a status maps to is the same everywhere:
 *
 *   tier "new"       -> NEW
 *   tier "packing"    -> PACKING, READY_TO_SHIP
 *   tier "shipped"     -> SHIPPED
 *   tier "transit"      -> OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
 *   tier "delivered"     -> DELIVERED
 *   tier "cancelled"      -> CANCELLED, DELAYED
 *
 * Keep this list and the tier map below in sync if a new status is
 * ever introduced.
